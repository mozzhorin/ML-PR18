\section*{Version Explanation}
 
Due to the varying preferences and different tools of choice for generating PDF files, our submission is divided into two parts/documents which are complementary to each other. This Documnet includes the Mask R-CNN section of our project and complements the other part that is submitted separately. It was generated with LaTeX.
